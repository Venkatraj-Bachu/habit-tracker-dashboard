# habit-tracker-dashboard
This repository contains a Python script for interacting with the Pixela API, a service that allows you to create and manage graphs to track your daily activities or goals.

## Getting Started

Before running the script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to create an account on [Pixela](https://pixe.la/) and obtain your user token.

### API Documentation

### Usage
1. Set your username and user token in the script:
